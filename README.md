# gpt_card_analyzer

TO DO:

Barebones necessities
✅ get program set up to make a query to either (one of) chatgpt or gemini
* get program set up to write to a google sheets document
* * get program set up to write to a second tab in a sheet
* get program set up to allow program permission to access google sheet
* get program set up to use an image as input for the llm query
* get app set up to allow user to take pic or upload pic to app

UI beautification
* refine query to get more specific output and clarify the workflow
* draw out the popup for "is this your card?" - include menu to click on the specifics about the card (graded, sport, etc) and either proceed or try again to identify the card

* figure out how to hide public api key? Is it possible?
* multi-model referencing
* set up queries to the other llm
* * can either choose one, the other, or both, and get charged accordingly with no additional markup
* set up queries for other card games - magic, yugioh, etc
* * all in one spreadsheet? Should probably be able to swap sheets, or have multiple plugged in


Past MVP
* set up app for payments
